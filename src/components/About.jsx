            I have a strong love for building aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly websites and applications as a self-taught front end developer. Through my own effort and resourcefulness, I have taught myself the necessary knowledge and technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I can quickly adapt to new problems and technology because to my self-taught background, and my attention to detail makes me a valuable member of any team.
